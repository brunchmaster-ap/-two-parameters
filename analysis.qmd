This topic is about the population, a survey between males and females, and their body, race, height etc. The data source is NHANES, and we want to answer the question of how do other variables affect height? However, our estimates may be biased if the sample does not fully represent all age groups or if changes in height over time are not accounted for.We model adult height as a linear function of sex to estimate how average height differs between men and women. Our analysis estimates that men are on average 10.8 centimeters taller than women, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 8.6 to 13.1 centimeters, reflecting the uncertainty around this height difference.
