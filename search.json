However, our estimates may be biased if the sample does not fully represent all age groups or if changes in height over time are not accounted for.We model adult height as a linear function of sex to estimate how average height differs between men and women. Our analysis estimates that men are on average 10.8 centimeters taller than women, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 8.6 to 13.1 centimeters, reflecting the uncertainty around this height difference."
